# dotfiles
My dotfiles and soon, an installation script for them.

Currently doesn't contain very much. I will adapt everything for use with GNU stow in the future, all while having a setup script running.

The installer script is mostly complete, however take note that that is meant to be used for Fedora 33, but you can reference it step by step with what your distro would do instead.
